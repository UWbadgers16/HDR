# AdvancedHDR for Windows Phone 8.1
CS 766 HDR app

## Motivation
The AdvancedHDR project was started with the goal of bring a full High Dynamic Range implemented to the WinRT environment. Nokia, one of the world's leaders in digital imaging on smartphones, joined Microsoft several years ago to create Nokia-made Windows Phones. Nokia Pureview technology has brought many new enhancements to smartphone photography, such as the [Nokia Lumia 1020](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/phone/lumia1020/), which brings a 41 MP sensor to a smartphone. With these considerations, and without a current implementation in the operating system, it was my goal to show that full HDR photography is fully realizable on a smartphone.
